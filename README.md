### ABOUT ME

Hi! My name is Ghafar Shah. I really enjoy learning, discovering and extracting insights from data! I love coding in Python (Numpy / Pandas), using Tableau to create data visualizations, and blogging about my analytics projects and experiences.

I am an experienced data analyst at Comcast with a strong passion in data visualization (Tableau), quantitative / qualitative analysis, and geospatial analysis (Python). I'm also a member of the Philadelphia Tableau User Group (PhillyTUG) leadership committee.
